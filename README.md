# 🎯 About

This app was developed for practicing react js. It allows you to make your own burger by interactively adding the ingredients and order it.<br/>
The homepage of the app displays a burger and controls for you to add ingredients to the burger.<br/>
You can find the total amount for your burger in the same page.<br/>
After you purchase, a modal is shown which shows your order summary. Then, you can order the burger. If the backend logic is available along with a database, your order is sent to the database.<br/>
If the backend logic is absent or an error occured in the backend, the error is caught and displayed in a modal.<br/>
Also, the app is mobile friendly, a side bar appears for mobile devices insead of the navigation bar.<br/>
